### Color Names

Styles are much easier to change if we can refer to our custom colors by name.

Components can declare their own color names by defining a style registry in the component style options.

The bundled plugins handle color name lookup but if you are writing your own plugins and want to support color name lookup for color values you need to test the `colors` map:

```javascript
[
  ({prop, colors}) => {
    return {backgroundColor: colors[prop] || prop}
  },
  {bulletColor: PropTypes.string}
]
```

### Flat Styles

Sometimes you are wrapping a third-party component and want to proxy the `style` object to the component but it does not accept an array for the `style` property; it enforces an object only property type.

The computed `style` property passed to your component is guaranteed to be an array; here however we need it to be an object. To do so you can use the `flat` option:

```javascript
static styleOptions = () => {
  return {
    flat: true
  }
}
```

Now you can just proxy it to the child component knowing it will be an object:

```javascript
render () {
  const {style} = this.props
  return (
    <NonIdiomaticComponent style={style} />
  )
}
```
